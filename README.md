Hello !

Project name : "Recipes"

---- In this project I used basic HTML to build a recipe webpage. ----

The main page has img element fallowed by an unordered list containing 3 links to other pages.

Each recipe has its own page containing an image of the food, a description, an unordered list of the ingredients and a ordered list for the steps.

Furthermore at the bottom of each recipe page I added a link that takes you back to the main page where all the recipes are located.
